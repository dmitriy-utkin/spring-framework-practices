The Spring Course Practices project is a console application for managing contacts. It uses profiles for applications and bean injections. 
The main features include printing all contacts, adding new contacts, removing contacts, and stopping the application. 
The model structure consists of a Contact class with fields for full name, phone number, and email. 
Contact objects are stored in a List in temporary storage. The configuration structure includes application properties with main string values, error messages, paths for input/output features, template messages for launcher, and rules for user input validation. 
The application supports two profiles: default and init. The main beans for practice include DefaultUploadServiceImpl.java for launching without external data set uploading and InitUploadServiceImpl.java for launching with data set uploading. 
You can change the profile settings to choose between the two options.

The Spring Course Practices project is a console application that incorporates Docker, Spring Shell, and Event Listening. 
It introduces the use of config beans, event listener creation, and containerization with Docker. 
The main configuration points include setting the active profile for the application, enabling event listening, and uploading data. 
The application's model consists of a simple POJO for students, a custom CRUD repository, and custom event realizations. 
The application can be launched using Docker or directly in an IDE. 
The main console commands allow users to add new students, print saved students, and remove students by ID or all at once.
