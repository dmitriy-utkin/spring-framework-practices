# SPRING COURSE FIFTH PRACTICE

New features: Redis for caching of the response (like books by name, name+author, id, categories) 
with eviction when update/delete/create any antities. Also added test with using of the Testcontainer. 
Implemented RESTful paradigm with additional end points for testing some features, 
docker-compose for convenient launch of third-party services (like Redis, PostgreSQL).

## Practice 5th tasks:
0. CRUD application for manage of the books (create new one, update existed, delete, find all or part by exact request) with MVC and RESTful principles.
1. Development with Redis.
2. Data caching in Redis.

Additional tasks:
1. Implementation Testcontainers

## The main configuration points:

## How launch this application?

## What can you do here?

## How caching with Redis is working?

## How Testcontainers is working?
